Modern real-world transactional workloads such as bills of materials or telecommunication billing need to process both short transactions and long transactions. Recent concurrency control protocols do not cope with such workloads since they assume only classical workloads (i.e., YCSB and TPC-C) that have relatively short transactions. To this end, we proposed a new concurrency control protocol Shirakami. Shirakami has two sub-protocols. Shirakami-LTX protocol is for long transactions based on multiversion concurrency control and Shirakami-OCC protocol is for short transactions based on Silo. Shirakami naturally integrates them with write preservation method and epoch-based synchronization. Shirakami is a module in Tsurugi system, which is a production-purpose relational database system.
