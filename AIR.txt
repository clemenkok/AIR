Here are 5 novel cryptographic hash function concepts, inspired by the reviewed papers:

1. Spectral Permutation Hash (SPH)
Methodology: Combines ideas from Spectral Hashing (Weiss et al.) with permutation-based approaches like BLAKE3. The input would first undergo spectral decomposition using eigenvector analysis, similar to how Spectral Hashing processes data. These spectral components would then be fed into a permutation-based compression function that operates on fixed-width blocks.

Viability: Potentially viable for specialized applications where data has natural spectral properties. The main challenge would be ensuring collision resistance across all input types. The spectral preprocessing could provide interesting diffusion properties.

Inspiration: Spectral Hashing paper's eigenfunction approach combined with BLAKE3's permutation design.

2. Tree-Based Adaptive Hash (TAH) 
Methodology: Creates a dynamic tree structure where the branching factor adapts based on input characteristics, unlike BLAKE3's fixed binary tree. The adaptation would follow rules based on input entropy measurements. High-entropy regions get more branches for better parallelization, while low-entropy regions use fewer branches to optimize processing.

Viability: Promising for handling diverse input types efficiently, but would need careful design to maintain consistent security properties across different tree configurations. Implementation complexity is a concern.

Inspiration: BLAKE3's tree hashing combined with Streebog's structural elements.

3. Hybrid Sponge-Spectral Hash (HSSH)
Methodology: Uses a hybrid construction combining the sponge function approach from SHA-3/KECCAK with spectral transformation stages. The absorption phase would include spectral decomposition steps between permutation rounds, potentially providing stronger mixing properties.

Viability: Theoretically interesting but may be computationally expensive. Would need extensive security analysis to verify the interaction between sponge and spectral components.

Inspiration: SHA-3's sponge construction combined with spectral analysis concepts.

4. Multi-Domain Parallel Hash (MDPH)
Methodology: Processes input in parallel across multiple independent "domains" with different parameters (similar to SHA-3's domain separation but concurrent). Final output combines results using a novel domain mixing function. Each domain could use different internal constants and round functions.

Viability: Good potential for high-performance applications. Main challenge would be proving independence between domains and ensuring the mixing function preserves security properties.

Inspiration: BLAKE3's parallelization approach and SHA-3's domain separation concept.

5. Recursive Spectral Compression Hash (RSCH)
Methodology: Applies spectral compression recursively at multiple scales, creating a hierarchical hash structure. Each level would compress data using spectral properties before feeding into the next level. Final output combines information from all levels.

Viability: Interesting theoretical properties but likely too computationally intensive for general use. Could find applications in specialized domains where hierarchical structure matches the data.

Inspiration: Spectral Hashing's dimensionality reduction combined with BLAKE3's hierarchical approach.

Key Considerations for All Proposals:
- Security analysis would need to verify collision resistance, preimage resistance, and second preimage resistance
- Performance characteristics would need careful benchmarking
- Implementation complexity vs. security benefits would need evaluation
- Formal security proofs would be required
- Side-channel attack resistance would need verification

These proposals represent novel combinations of existing concepts while introducing new elements. Each would require extensive cryptanalysis and security proofs before practical implementation could be considered.
