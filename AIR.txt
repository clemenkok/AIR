Here are 5 original research ideas inspired by the papers:

1. Adaptive Hybrid Concurrency Control with Dynamic Protocol Switching
Rationale: Inspired by Shirakami's hybrid approach combining different protocols for short and long transactions. Could automatically switch between protocols based on workload characteristics.

Methodology:
- Develop metrics to classify transaction types in real-time
- Create switching mechanism between 2PL, MVCC, and optimistic protocols
- Implement machine learning model to predict optimal protocol based on workload patterns
- Evaluate performance impact of switching overhead vs benefits

2. Distributed Fair Thread ID Assignment for Decentralized Systems
Rationale: Extends the FairTID concept from T. Nguyen's paper to fully distributed systems without central coordination.

Methodology:
- Design distributed algorithm for thread ID assignment across nodes
- Implement vector clock synchronization between nodes
- Evaluate fairness and throughput compared to centralized approach
- Measure impact on network traffic and latency

3. Node-Level Concurrency Control with Hardware Transactional Memory
Rationale: Combine node-locking protocol with hardware transactional memory support for improved performance.

Methodology:
- Modify node-locking protocol to utilize HTM where available
- Implement fallback path for transaction aborts
- Compare performance with software-only approaches
- Analyze abort rates and causes

4. Starvation-Free Protocol for Mixed OLTP/OLAP Workloads
Rationale: Extend 2PLSF approach to handle both transactional and analytical queries efficiently.

Methodology:
- Design separate handling for short OLTP and long-running OLAP transactions
- Implement priority inheritance to prevent starvation
- Evaluate impact on both OLTP latency and OLAP throughput
- Compare with specialized HTAP systems

5. Phantom Prevention with Minimal Index Locking
Rationale: Improve scan performance while maintaining consistency by reducing index lock overhead.

Methodology:
- Develop new index structure supporting lightweight range locks
- Implement incremental validation for range scans
- Compare with traditional next-key locking approaches
- Measure impact on concurrent updates and phantom prevention

Each idea builds upon concepts from the papers while exploring new directions. The methodologies focus on practical implementation and empirical evaluation to demonstrate improvements over existing approaches.

These ideas address important challenges in concurrent database systems while maintaining the balance between consistency and performance that was emphasized in the source papers.
